dojot documentation
============================

This is the high-level documentation for dojot IoT platform developed by CPqD. This platform aims to provide the
application and device developers with a more concise and integrated interaction, while benefiting for a highly
customizable and efficient infrastructure.

While this does provide an overall glimpse of the platform, this documentation is not suited for middleware developers
that might want to better understand the components that compose the solution themselves. For that, please check the
component's own documentation repositories and ReadTheDocs pages.
