"Use one of the available IoT agents: currently, there is support for "
"MQTT-based devices. If your project is using (or allows changing to) this"
" protocol, then it would suffice to check if the device is sending its "
"data using a simple key/value JSON. If it isn't, then you might want to "
"use iotagent-mosca (check `iotagent-mosca`_ documentation to check out "
"how to do that). If it is indeed sending key/value JSON messages, then it"
" can send its messages to dojot's broker and it will be recognized by the"
" platform."

"Create a new IoT agent to support the protocol used by the device: if "
"your device is using another protocol that is not yet supported, then it "
"might be a good idea to implement a new IoT agent. It's not that hard, "
"but there are a few details that must be taken into account. To help "
"developers to do such thing, there is the `iotagent-nodejs`_ library "
"which deals with most internal mechanisms and messages - check its "
"documentation to know more."
