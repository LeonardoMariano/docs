"In dojot, a device is a digital representation of an actual device or "

msgstr ""

#: ../../source/faq/faq.rst:127
msgid ""

"device*."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/faq/faq.rst:132
msgid ""
"We can also create devices which don’t directly correspond to their "
"actual ones, for instance, we can create one with higher level of "

"This kind of device is called *virtual device*."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/faq/faq.rst:138
msgid "What is the relationship between this *device* and my actual device?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/faq/faq.rst:140
msgid ""
"It is simple as it seems: the *regular device* for dojot is a mirror "
"(digital twin) of your actual device. You can choose which attributes are"
" available for applications and other components by adding each one of "

msgid ""
"*Regular devices* are created to serve as a mirror (digital twin) for the"
" actual devices and sensors. A *virtual device* is an abstraction that "
"models things that are not feasible in the real world. For instance, "
"let's say that a user has few smoke detectors in a laboratory, each one "
"with different attributes. Wouldn't it be nice if we had one device "
"called *Laboratory* that has one attribute *isOnFire*? So, the "
"applications could rely only on this attribute to take an action."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/faq/faq.rst:156
msgid ""
"Another difference is how virtual devices are populated. Regular ones "

" to follow some rules:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/faq/faq.rst:171
msgid ""
"MQTT topic must follow the pattern ``/<service-id>/<device-id>/attrs``, "
"where ``<service-id>`` is an identifier associated with the user account "
