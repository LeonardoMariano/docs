"The scenario is: we have a courier delivery services company and we need "
"to track individual packages. The current package tracking is based only "
"on manually scanning each device's bar code at departure and arrival in "
"distribution centers. What we want is a more fine-grained system that "
"allows checking where a particular package is (or it should be) in the "
"meantime."

"The idea behind this is: associate each package to a vehicule and, "
"whenever an update from the vehicule is received, this solution also "
"updates all associated packages. The association could be done by the "
"vehicule itself - each time a new device is registered by its RFID "
"scanners, it sends a message to dojot indicating that the device is now "
"associated to it. This message would be processed by a new software "
"component (to be developed in this tutorial) that performs this "
"association, as currently there is no module responsible for \"device "
"associations\". When a vehicule sends a new location, this update is also"
" processed by the association module, which in turn will update the "
"location from all associated packages."
