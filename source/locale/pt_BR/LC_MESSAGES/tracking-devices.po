"In this tutorial we will focus on how to track devices and how to use "
"flows to perform specific actions when a device reaches a particular "
"area. Furthermore, we will see a few more GUI functionalities not covered"

"The scenario we'll build in this tutorial will be as follows: a truck is "
"carrying a container from Campinas to Pouso Alegre and we want to be "
"notified when it exits Campinas, when passes by Extrema and when it "
"reaches its destination. The map is shown below to help you better "
"visualize where everything is located."
