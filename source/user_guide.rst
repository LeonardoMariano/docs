User Guide
==========

This document provides information on how to use dojot. On that regard, this
should describe the steps required to install and operate the platform from a
device developer or application developer point of view. For documentation
regarding the operation of the platform itself, please refer to the
:doc:`ops_guide`.

Who should read this
--------------------

- Users that want a deeper look at how dojot works;
- Application developers.


Getting Started
---------------

To start, please follow dojot's installation guide in
:doc:`install/compose_guide`. There you should find how to properly download a
working copy of the components, how to minimally configure them, how to start
them up and how to check whether they are working.

dojot basics
------------

Before using dojot, you should be familiar with some basic operations and
concepts. They are very simple to understand and use, but without them, all
operations might become obscure and senseless. It is advisable to checkout our
:doc:`architecture` to get acquainted with all internal components.

First of all, you should check out how to acccess dojot through its APIs, which
is detailed in the next section. After that, there's an explanation of a few
basic entities in dojot: devices, templates and flows (including a simple
tutorial on how to create and use them).

All these instructions considers only API access. For a guided tour on how to
use the web interface, check dojot's `YouTube channel`_.

User authentication
*******************

All HTTP requests supported by dojot are sent to the API gateway. In order to
control which user should access which endpoints and resources, dojot makes
uses of `JSON Web Token`_ (a useful tool is `jwt.io`_) which encodes things
like (not limited to these):

- User identity
- Validation data
- Timestamp

The component responsible for user authentication is `auth`_. You can find a
tutorial of how to authenticate a user and how to get an access token in `auth
documentation`_.


Devices and templates
*********************

In dojot, a device is a digital representation of an actual device or gateway
with one or more sensors or of a virtual one with sensors/attributes inferred
from other devices. Throughout the documentation, this kind of device will be
called simply as 'device'. If the actual device must be referenced, we'll be
calling it as 'physical device'.

Consider, for instance, a physical device with temperature and humidity
sensors; it can be represented in dojot as a device with two attributes (one
for each sensor). We call this kind of device as regular device or by its
communication protocol, for instance, MQTT device or CoAP device.

We can also create devices which donâ€™t directly correspond to their physical
counterparts, for instance, we can create one with higher level of information
of temperature (is becoming hotter or is becoming colder) whose values are
inferred from temperature sensors of other devices. This kind of device is
called virtual device.

All devices are created based on a *template*, which can be thought as a model
of a device. As "model" we could think of part numbers or product models - one
*prototype* from which devices are created. Templates in dojot have one label
(any alphanumeric sequence), a list of attributes which will hold all the
device emitted information, and optionally a few special attributes which will
indicate how the device communicates, including transmission methods (protocol,
ports, etc.) and message formats.

In fact, templates can represent not only "device models", but it can also
abstract a "class of devices". For instance, we could have one template to
represent all thermometers that will be used in dojot. This template would have
only one attribute called, let's say, "temperature". While creating the device,
the user would select its "physical template", let's say *TexasInstr882*, and
the 'thermometer' template. The user would have also to add translation
instructions in order to map the temperature reading that will be sent from the
device to a "temperature" attribute.

In order to create a device, a user selects which templates are going to
compose this new device. All their attributes are merged together and
associated to it - they are tightly linked to the original template so that any
template update will reflect all associated devices.

The component responsible for managing devices (both real and virtual) and
templates is `DeviceManager`_. `DeviceManager documentation`_ explains in more
depth all the available operations.


Flows
*****

This section will explain what a flow is and how to use it. It will be filled
as soon as `mashup`_ documentation is ready.

Step-by-step device management
******************************

This section provides a complete step-by-step tutorial of how to create,
update, send messages to and check historical data of a device. We will create
a simple device with only one attribute, send a few messages emulating the
physical device and check the historical data for the only attribute this
device has.

Also, this tutorial assumes that you are using `docker-compose`_, which has all
the necessary components to properly run dojot (so all API requests will be
sent to localhost:8000).

Getting access token
++++++++++++++++++++

As said in `User authentication`_, all requests must contain a valid access
token. You can generate a new token by sending the following request:

.. code-block:: bash

  curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/auth \
         -H 'Content-Type:application/json' \
         -d '{"username": "admin", "passwd" : "admin"}'

  {"jwt": "eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiL..."}

If you want to generate a token for other user, just change the username and
password in the request payload. The token ("eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiL...") should be
used in every HTTP request sent to dojot in a special header. Such request
would look like:

.. code-block:: bash 

   curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/device \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiL..." 

Remember that the token must be set in the request header as a whole, not parts
of it. In the example only the first characters are shown for the sake of
simplicity. All further requests will use a bash variable called ``bash
${JWT}``, which contains the token got from auth component.


Device creation
+++++++++++++++

In order to properly configure a physical device in dojot, you must first
create its representation in the platform. The example presented here is just a
small part of what is offered by DeviceManager. For more information, check the
`DeviceManager how-to`_ for more detailed instructions.

First of all, let's create a template for the device - all devices are based
off of a template, remember.

.. code-block:: bash

    curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/template \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer ${JWT}" \
    -H 'Content-Type:application/json' \
    -d ' {
      "label": "Thermometer Template",
      "attrs": [
        {
          "label": "temperature",
          "type": "dynamic",
          "value_type": "float"
        }
      ]
    }'

This request should give back this message:


.. code-block:: json
   :linenos:

    {
      "result": "ok",
      "template": {
        "created": "2018-01-25T12:30:42.164695+00:00",
        "data_attrs": [
          {
            "template_id": "1",
            "created": "2018-01-25T12:30:42.167126+00:00",
            "label": "temperature",
            "value_type": "float",
            "type": "dynamic",
            "id": 1
          }
        ],
        "label": "Thermometer Template",
        "config_attrs": [],
        "attrs": [
          {
            "template_id": "1",
            "created": "2018-01-25T12:30:42.167126+00:00",
            "label": "temperature",
            "value_type": "float",
            "type": "dynamic",
            "id": 1
          }
        ],
        "id": 1
      }
    }

Note that the template ID is 1 (line 27).

To create a template based on it, send the following request to dojot:

.. code-block:: bash
    :linenos:

    curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/device \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer ${JWT}" \
    -H 'Content-Type:application/json' \
    -d ' {
      "templates": [
        "1"
      ],
      "label": "device"
    }'


The template ID list on line 6 contains the only template ID configured so far.
To check out the configured device, just send a GET request to /device:

.. code-block:: bash

    curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/device -H "Authorization: Bearer ${JWT}"


Which should give back:

.. code-block:: bash

    {
      "pagination": {
        "has_next": false,
        "next_page": null,
        "total": 1,
        "page": 1
      },
      "devices": [
        {
          "templates": [
            1
          ],
          "created": "2018-01-25T12:36:29.353958+00:00",
          "attrs": {
            "1": [
              {
                "template_id": "1",
                "created": "2018-01-25T12:30:42.167126+00:00",
                "label": "temperature",
                "value_type": "float",
                "type": "dynamic",
                "id": 1
              }
            ]
          },
          "id": "0998",
          "label": "device_0"
        }
      ]
    }


Sending messages
++++++++++++++++

So far we got an access token and created a template and a device based on it.
In an actual deployment, the physical device would send messages to dojot with
all its attributes and their current values. For this tutorial we will send
MQTT messages by hand to the platform, emulating such physical device. For
that, we will use mosquitto_pub from Mosquitto project.

.. ATTENTION::
    Some Linux distributions, Ubuntu in particular, have two packages for
    `mosquitto`_ - one containing tools to access it (i.e. mosquitto_pub and
    mosquitto_sub for publishing messages and subscribing to topics) and
    another one containing the MQTT broker. In this tutorial, only the tools
    are going to be used. Please check if MQTT broker is not running before 
    starting dojot (by running commands like ``ps aux | grep mosquitto``).


The dojot compatible format for messages sent by devices is a simple key-value 
JSON, such as:

.. code-block:: json

    {
      "temperature" : 10.6
    }

Let's send this message to dojot:

.. code-block:: bash

  mosquitto_pub -t /admin/0998/attrs -m '{"temperature": 10.6}'

If there is no output, the message was sent to MQTT broker. The topic is build 
from the following information:

- admin: user tenant. This is retrieved from "service" attribute from user
  configuration.
- 0998: device ID. This is retrieved from the device itself. It is returned
  when the device is created or read from /device endpoint.

To check if it was correctly processed by dojot, send the following request:

.. code-block:: bash
    
    curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/metric/v2/entities/0998 \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer ${JWT}" \
    -H "Fiware-Service: admin" \
    -H "Fiware-ServicePath:/"


This would result in the following message:

.. code-block:: json

    {
      "id": "0998",
      "type": "template_1",
      "temperature": {
        "type": "Number",
        "value": 10.6,
        "metadata": {}
      }
    }

.. NOTE:: The device type is a string formed by "template\_" concatenated with 
  all template IDs that form it.

For more information on how dojot deals with data sent from devices, check the
`Integrating physical devices`_ section.

Checking historical data
++++++++++++++++++++++++

In order to check all values that were sent from a device for a particular
attribute, you could use the `history APIs`_. Let's first send a few other
values to dojot so we can get a few more interesting results:


.. code-block:: bash

  mosquitto_pub -t /admin/0998/attrs -m '{"temperature": 10.6}'
  mosquitto_pub -t /admin/0998/attrs -m '{"temperature": 15.6}'
  mosquitto_pub -t /admin/0998/attrs -m '{"temperature": 36.5}'


To retrieve all values sent for temperature attribute of this device:

.. code-block:: bash

  curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/history/STH/v1/contextEntities/type/template_1/id/0998/attributes/temperature?lastN=3 \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer ${JWT}" \
    -H "Fiware-Service:admin"\
    -H "Fiware-ServicePath:/"

The history endpoint is built from these values:

- ``.../type/template_1/id/0998/...``: the device type is ``template_1`` - this
  is retrieved from the ``type`` attribute from the device. Same for the ID
  (``0998``)
- ``.../attributes/temperature?lastN=3``: the requested attribute is
  temperature and it should get the last 3 values. More operators are available
  in `STH data retrieval`_

  The request should result in the following message:

.. code-block:: json

  {
    "contextResponses": [
      {
        "contextElement": {
          "attributes": [
            {
              "name": "temperature",
              "values": [
                {
                  "recvTime": "2018-01-25T14:57:21.027Z",
                  "attrType": "Number",
                  "attrValue": 10.6
                },
                {
                  "recvTime": "2018-01-25T14:57:21.063Z",
                  "attrType": "Number",
                  "attrValue": 15.6
                },
                {
                  "recvTime": "2018-01-25T14:57:21.701Z",
                  "attrType": "Number",
                  "attrValue": 36.5
                }
              ]
            }
          ],
          "id": "0998",
          "isPattern": false,
          "type": "template_1"
        },
        "statusCode": {
          "code": "200",
          "reasonPhrase": "OK"
        }
      }
    ]
  }

This message contains all previously sent values. More information about what
can be done with historical data can be found in `STH documentation`_.


Integrating physical devices
----------------------------

This section should detail how to integrate a new device with the system. That
should encompass the both the communication requirements imposed on the device
in order to allow its usage with the platform, as well as the steps (if any,
depending on the protocol used) to configure this new device within the
platform.

This could also explain (if indeed implemented) the device management
functionalities made available by the platform to the device developer.

Regarding the requirements imposed on the devices, it is forseen that, for each
communication scheme (protocol/serialization format) offically supported by the
platform, a step by step guide on how to "develop" a device is supplied. Such
guide can, if applicable, make use of a platform-provided library or SDK.


Flow Management
---------------

Moving to the perspective of an aplication developer, this section should list
and explain the usage of the information flow configuration process within the
platform - how to use the provided gui, high level description of the APIs that
can be used to configure such flows, available actions to be used when building
the flows, so on and so forth.
