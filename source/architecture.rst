Architecture
============

This document describes the current architecture that guides the middleware implementation, detailing
the components that comprise the solution, as well as their functionalities and how each of them
contribute to the platform as a whole.

While a brief explanation of each component is provided, this high level description does not
explain (or aims to explain) the minutia of each component's implementation. For that, please
refer to each component's own documentation.
